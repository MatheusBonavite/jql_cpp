# JQL_CPP
A JSON Query Language CLI tool built with C++. Heavily inspired on [JQL](https://github.com/yamafaktory/jql).

# Core Philosophy
- Understand the C++ language better.
- Build a somehow useful tool.
- Generate reports based on JSON input.

# Non-goal
- Be efficiently competitive to its alternatives (like JQL).
- Work the same way as JQL or jq or any other CLI.
